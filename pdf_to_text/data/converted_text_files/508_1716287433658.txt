* EBITDA includes interest income and the share of results of equity accounted investees which is based on the share of profit after tax but excludes all 
impacts from foreign currency exchange gains and losses (other than for equity accounted investees), to demonstrate the underlying cash operational 
performance of businesses.
• During the fourth quarter, the Group reported a strong 
performance across most businesses, with Consumer Foods, 
Transportation and Leisure, in particular, recording significant 
growth. The performance seen in most of the businesses is 
a reflection of the improving macroeconomic conditions in 
the country and is a continuation of the growth momentum 
witnessed in the third quarter of 2023/24. 
• Recurring Group EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2023/24 
recorded a growth of 20% to Rs.13.97 billion [Q4 2022/23: 
Rs.11.65 billion]. This growth is despite a higher surplus 
recognition at UA in the fourth quarter of the previous year due 
to a timing difference, and the appreciation of the Sri Lankan 
Rupee by approximately 12%. The average exchange rate was 
Rs.355 in the fourth quarter of 2022/23 compared to Rs.313 in 
the fourth quarter 2023/24, which had a negative translation 
impact on businesses with foreign currency denominated 
revenue streams. Further, the Group recognised of an asset 
write-off amounting to Rs.639 million in the Property industry 
group, as explained below. 
• The strong growth in the Transportation industry group was 
driven by the Bunkering business, Lanka Marine Services, on 
account of a significant growth in volumes over 50% due 
to the Red Sea crisis which resulted in an increase in vessel 
traffic to the coastal waters of Sri Lanka. The Group’s Port and 
Shipping business, South Asia Gateway Terminals (SAGT), 
recorded an increase in throughput of 13%. which drove 
growth in profitability. 
• Both the Frozen Confectionery and Beverages businesses 
recorded strong growth in profitability, driven by improved 
margins and significant volume increases of 24% and 42%, 
respectively. It should be noted that volumes in the fourth 
quarter of the previous year were lower given the reduction 
in consumer discretionary spend. The volume growth is 
encouraging, particularly in Beverages, where selling prices 
of certain SKUs were increased to cover the higher sugar tax 
and VAT rate increase. Favourable weather conditions, where 
the country encountered higher than usual temperatures, also 
supported the growth in volumes. • Profitability of the Supermarket business was driven by 
growth in same store sales of 11%, driven by a growth in 
footfall of 14%. EBITDA recorded growth despite the cost 
escalations compared to the previous quarter, primarily due 
to the significant increase in electricity tariffs. The business is 
expected to see an improvement in energy costs in 2024/25 
due to the downward revision of electricity tariffs in March 
2024.
• Profitability of the Leisure industry group was driven by a 
strong recovery in the Sri Lankan Leisure businesses, on 
the back of a sustained recovery in tourist arrivals to the 
country, which resulted in higher occupancy and a significant 
improvement in ARRs across the portfolio. The Maldivian 
Resorts and Destination Management businesses also saw 
encouraging growth in EBITDA. The costs pertaining to the 
ramp up associated with the Cinnamon Life hotel at ‘City of 
Dreams Sri Lanka’ increased on account of the impending 
opening of the hotel in Q3 2024/25.
• The Property industry group EBITDA includes an asset write-
off amounting to Rs.639 million relating to the closure of the 
‘K-Zone’ mall in Ja-Ela for the development of the ‘VIMAN’ 
residential project, resulting in the existing assets becoming 
redundant. Given the demand for suburban living spaces, 
the Group is of the view that the project is an optimum 
monetisation of such land through development and sales. 
Excluding the asset write-off, the Property industry group 
EBITDA was Rs.5 million.
• NTB recorded a significant growth in profitability driven 
by robust loan growth. UA recorded a higher surplus and 
shareholder profit although this did not reflect in the quarterly 
performance due to a timing difference of the recognition of 
the surplus in the previous year which impacted the base. 2
