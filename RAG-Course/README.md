# RAG From Scratch

This directory contains materials from a comprehensive course on building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems from scratch. The course covers fundamental concepts and practical implementations of RAG techniques.

## Course Overview

RAG is a powerful mechanism to expand an LLM's knowledge base, using documents retrieved from an external data source to ground the LLM generation via in-context learning. This approach addresses limitations of LLMs trained on fixed data corpora, allowing them to reason about private or recent information without costly fine-tuning.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into several Jupyter notebooks, each covering specific aspects of RAG:

1. `rag_from_scratch_1_to_4.ipynb`: Introduction and basic concepts
2. `rag_from_scratch_5_to_9.ipynb`: Intermediate techniques
3. `rag_from_scratch_10_and_11.ipynb`: Advanced topics (Part 1)
4. `rag_from_scratch_12_to_14.ipynb`: Advanced topics (Part 2)
5. `rag_from_scratch_15_to_18.ipynb`: Final sections and practical applications

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the notebooks in order and follow along with the instructions.
